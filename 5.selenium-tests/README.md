1. `yarn add selenium-webdriver -D`
2. `yarn add gecko-driver -D`
3. I have added the code for testing the login success with selenium in file named as `LoginSuccessfull.test.js`.
4. It works fine with jest I have tested that by copying that file content in `loginSuccessfull.test.js` inside the login component.
